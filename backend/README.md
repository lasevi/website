# Flask Backend

The backend of the website is built with the Flask framework in Python.

## Installation

First, create a virtual environment for the backend:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

And activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source venv/bin/activate`.

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To start the Flask backend, use the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
